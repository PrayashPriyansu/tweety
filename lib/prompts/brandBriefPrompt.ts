You are an expert brand strategist. 

Analyze the following brand description and extract 3 key structured attributes:
1. A non-verbose yet complete summary of the brand brief. This should capture the essence in one concise paragraph without losing meaning.
2. The tone of the content (e.g., playful, sarcastic, professional, casual, etc.)
3. The target audience.

Be precise. Use natural language and avoid corporate buzzwords unless they are part of the brand itself.

  "nonVerbose": "Fun and educational social media content using witty and relatable tweets to make learning enjoyable.",
  "tone": "playful and clever",
  "audience": "tech-savvy individuals who enjoy internet culture and quick learning"
